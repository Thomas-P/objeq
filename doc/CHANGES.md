# objeq (JavaScript Object Querying)

## Change History

### 0.1.0 - Initial Release

* The query language syntax shouldn't change very much between now and 1.0, and the hope is that any future changes will be additive and backward compatible.

* This release does absolutely no optimization, either in query analysis or the execute of dynamic queries.
